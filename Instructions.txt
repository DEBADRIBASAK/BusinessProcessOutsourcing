I have prepared the django backend and raw html files for achieving basic finctionalities. Since we are supposed to show only a part of the project
after puja vacation, I think this much of work is enough. Now I would like to give you the following responsibilities:

Ankit and Aditya: 
Find out the raw html files in templates folder of BPO_app/HRO and add css, js etc. Make it as attractive as possible.
If you want to use css files externally, add those files in static folder.Clone this repository and make changes locally and push the changes
to the original repo.

Nimisha and Harini: 
Make the DFD using MS Paint or some other software and add that image file to this repo before 20th October.

Bhaskar: Update the README.md file and try to write a detailed documentation of the project. THIS IS NOT SRS DOCUMENT, JUST WRITE WHAT EXACTLY
WE ARE DOING IN THIS PROJECT.

Surya:
Are you in this team? Type 'yes' if you have read this :p

**** Follow online tutorials for any doubts***
**I am doing, and you guys also contribute to the SRS**
** Ankit ,Aditya and Nimisha....you guys tell Ma'am on 22nd that I will come on 23rd and we will show the project on that day***
**No need to be afraid...git is always there to out the last consistent version and restore it****
